# I *FORCED* an AI to calculate distances for 30 UNBEARABLE MINUTES

ChatGPT (GPT3.5 model) can calculate the great-circle distance (a straight line) between any two cities quite accurately. We've seen that it can memorise the coordinates of cities, which seems very plausible as there's only ~4,000 cities in the world (of at least population 100,000). But if we consider the problem of  calculating the distance between possible pairs of cities, then thereâ€™s 8 million different pairs. I would expect that this is a problem difficult to memorise and can't imagine there's enough training data for such. If we assume ChatGPT is not memorising, but can calculate then that is also an impressive feat, because the haversine formula is very complex.

```python
def haversine(lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2):
  lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(math.radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])
  dlon = lon2 - lon1 
  dlat = lat2 - lat1 
  a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2 
  c = 6371 * 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a)) 
  return c * r
```

Accurate trigonometric, inverse trigonometric calculation and several steps of calculations seem beyond the scope of what I've seen GPT3 so this is interesting.
