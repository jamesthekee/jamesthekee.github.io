# Game of the amazons

I've been developing my Game of the Amazons thing for my website, it's been mildly enjoyable and it's cool to do something from raw html, js and css - even if admittedly used chatGPT for the inane parts.

Something of my psychology to bear in mind during this project, is well a bias to perfection, completion, away from abandoning and the inability to forget old projects. That's how I even returned to this project.

## The actual feature

I want to add some basic AI, so that I have actually implemented an AI in my life (video game AI not a fricking LLM). And having some tom7 level fun and doing several progressions of AI seem fun, so here's the plan.

Levels:
1. Random moves bot.
2. Random variations, moves books.
3. Minimax with various heuristics.
    a. Relative territory heuristic
