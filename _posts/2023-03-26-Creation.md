# Why create a bad website

I usually don't share or publisise my bad projects - most of them seem boring. Now I choose to go against that habit, to enjoy making bad projects and to enjoy writing about them. I could elaborate more, but I wouldn't be saying anything new. Sharing is fun, it enhances projects, and if others also enjoy my creations that's great.

### Broad goals

Nothing is more embarassing and encouraging than publically declaring goals so here are a few of mine:
1. Do something in any of the below topics, who cares if it's derivative
    * shaders
    * simulations
    * transformers / useful NLP
    * basic NNs
    * evolutionary algorithms
2. Create 8 posts this year
