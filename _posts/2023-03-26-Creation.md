# Why this website exists

I've made a lot of "projects", and I've abandoned just as many. I suppose I feel bad about a lot of them, and so I usually don't share or them - most of them seem boring. Now I choose to go against that habit, to enjoy making bad projects and to enjoy writing about them. I could elaborate more, but I wouldn't be saying anything new. Sharing is fun, it enhances projects, and if others also enjoy my creations that's great.

So that's why this website exists, an excuse to write, and an excuse to share. 

### My goals with the website

Nothing is more embarassing and encouraging than publically declaring goals so here are a few of mine:
1. Write something on any of the below topics, with no concern for originality:
    * shaders
    * simulations
    * transformers / useful NLP
    * basic NNs
2. Create 4 new posts in 2024
