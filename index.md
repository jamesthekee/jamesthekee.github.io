## Welcome to my page

Hello I am James, I'm from the UK and I like creating stuff. I'm interested in <ins>simulations</ins>, <ins>machine learning</ins>, <ins>nlp</ins> and <ins>shaders</ins>. Hopefully I will add some more stuff about that on here in the coming future. 

Some of my github projects are here:

- [Centralised password manager](https://github.com/jamesthekee/password-manager)
- [This website](https://github.com/jamesthekee/jamesthekee.github.io)
- [Mathdoku game](https://github.com/jamesthekee/Mathdoku)
